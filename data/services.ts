        answer: 'Detection depth depends on soil conditions and the radar frequency used. Typically, drone GPR can detect features at depths of 1-5 metres, with shallower surveys providing higher resolution detail.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What can ground penetrating radar detect?',
        answer: 'GPR can detect buried utilities (pipes, cables), underground voids and cavities, geological layer boundaries, buried foundations, archaeological features, and changes in soil composition.',
